This project shows the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms to build models that,
after being trained and tested with finalized loans, could accurately predict the future status of
current loans issued by LendingClub during the 2015-2018 period. The different Machine Learning
algorithms used were: Artificial Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Random Forests,
XGBoost, and Gaussian Classifier. Ultimately, the model built using Artificial Neural Networks
yielded the better testing results and was therefore used to obtain the loan status predictions for the
totality of the current loans. Through the visualization of this results, patterns showed that a
considerable increase in loan defaults was foreseeable, due to a noticeable cutback in interest rates
in the period, which in turn incited a reckless increase in the total of borrowers, regardless of any
certainty if whether they could confront this obligations. The model and its results serve as a tool
that can be used to raise awareness about LendingClub’s operations, in order to advise for a change
which can reduce the company’s risk, whilst adhering to its commitment of providing simple
financial opportunities to individuals.
